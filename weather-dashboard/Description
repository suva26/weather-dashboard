For this assignment, I focused on creating a weather dashboard using React.js. I began by setting up the project and integrating the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. I designed components like SearchBar for user input, WeatherInfo to display weather details, and ErrorMessage for handling errors. To improve user experience, I ensured that the data was displayed clearly and the interface was responsive. I also structured the application in a modular way, ensuring components were reusable and maintainable. Overall, I aimed to make the dashboard visually appealing, intuitive, and functional.
